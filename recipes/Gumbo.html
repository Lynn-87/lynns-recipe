        <h3>how to make this dish</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><h4>Step 1:</h4>
                    <h5>roux</h5>
                    <p>Whisk together flour and 3/4 cup bacon drippings in a large, heavy saucepan over medium-low heat until smooth. 
                        Cook roux, whisking constantly, until it turns a rich mahogany brown color. 
                        <br>It can take 20 to 30 minutes; watch heat carefully and whisk constantly or roux will burn. 
                        Remove from heat; continue whisking until mixture stops cooking.</p> 
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Step 2:</h4>
                    <h5>Gumbo</h5>
                    <p>Place celery, onion, green bell pepper, and garlic into the work bowl of a food processor, and pulse until all vegetables are very finely chopped. 
                        Stir vegetables into the roux, and mix in sausage. 
                        Bring mixture to a simmer over medium-low heat, and cook until vegetables are tender, 10 to 15 minutes. 
                        Remove from heat, and set aside.</p>
                </li>
                <li><h4>Step 3:</h4>
                    <p>Combine water and beef bouillon cubes in a large Dutch oven or soup pot and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. 
                        Stir until bouillon cubes dissolve, then whisk roux mixture into the boiling water.</p> 
                </li>
                <li><h4>Step 4:</h4>
                    <p>Reduce heat to a simmer, and mix in sugar, salt, hot pepper sauce, Cajun seasoning, bay leaves, thyme, stewed tomatoes, and tomato sauce. 
                        Simmer soup over low heat for 1 hour; mix in 2 teaspoons of file gumbo powder at the 45-minute mark.</p> 
                </li>
                <li><h4>Step 5:</h4>
